Following the launch of Operation Euphrates Shield in August 2016, T\u00fcrkiye and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army seized control over the Turkish-Syrian border region in northern Syria. In January 2018, T\u00fcrkiye and allied Syrian rebel groups initiated an offensive against Afrin, an enclave controlled by Kurdish militia. In October 2019, following the withdrawal of US forces from the Syrian side of the border, T\u00fcrkiye launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters. Following the launch of Operation Claw-Sword in November 2022, T\u00fcrkiye and Syria have begun to engage in talks, but President Assad wants T\u00fcrkiye to withdraw before a direct meeting between the leaders can occur.\n\nThese conflicts involve a complex interplay of state and non-state actors, with significant humanitarian and legal implications.",

According to the research data provided, there are three conflicts involving both Turkey and Syria:\n\n1. **Non-international armed conflicts in Syria**: Multiple and overlapping non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) occurring in Syria. The Syrian Government and its allies are involved in NIACs against several rebel groups, including the Syrian National Army, Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamic State group, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and other smaller armed groups. Furthermore, there are also parallel NIACs between those armed groups operating in the territory. Additionally, multiple NIACs are taking place between foreign state forces and armed groups on Syrian territory: two parallel NIACs between the US-led coalition on the one hand, and the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda on the other hand; two NIACs between T\u00fcrkiye and respectively the Islamic State and Kurdish militia; and a NIAC between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\n2. **Military occupation of Syria by T\u00fcrkiye**: T\u00fcrkiye has been occupying parts of northern Syria since its armed incursion in August 2016. Following the launch of Operation Euphrates Shield in August 2016, T\u00fcrkiye and Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (also called Syria National Army, TBFSA) seized control over the Turkish-Syrian border region in northern Syria. In January 2018, T\u00fcrkiye and allied Syrian rebel groups initiated an offensive against Afrin, an enclave controlled by Kurdish militia. In October 2019, following the withdrawal of US forces from the Syrian side of the border, T\u00fcrkiye launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters. Following the launch of Operation Claw-Sword in November 2022, T\u00fcrkiye and Syria have begun to engage in talks, but President Assad wants T\u00fcrkiye to withdraw before a direct meeting between the leaders can occur.\n\n3. **International armed conflicts in Syria**: Syria is currently involved in multiple, parallel international armed conflicts (IACs) against the so-called \u2018Global Coalition\u2019 (led by the United States), T\u00fcrkiye, and Israel. It is worth recalling that T\u00fcrkiye is occupying parts of the northern territory of Syria, while Israel has been occupying the Golan Heights since 1967. Several parallel international armed conflicts are occurring in Syria, notably against the US-led coalition, T\u00fcrkiye, and Israel.",

            "Output": "Based on the research data provided from RULAC, there is one conflict that involves both Israel and Palestine:\n\n### Military Occupation of Palestine by Israel\n\n- **Conflict Overview**: Israel is occupying the territory of Palestine. Israel is internationally recognized as the occupying power in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Israel has occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip since the end of the Six-Day War in 1967. Today, this prolonged occupation of the territory of Palestine takes a unique form. Israel is the occupying power in the West Bank. However, as a result of the Oslo Accords, direct authority over the West Bank is divided between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Despite the modalities of this agreement, Israel retains effective control over the entire territory. Israel withdrew its ground forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, as part of a unilateral disengagement plan. However, consequent to the level of control still exercised by Israel over the Gaza Strip, Israel continues to be recognized as the occupying power. In view of recent events as they unfolded since 7 October, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, because of their belonging to Palestine, are fighting Israel within the framework of an international armed conflict. Moreover, as they meet the criteria of intensity and organization, the clashes between Israel and Hezbollah amount to a non-international armed conflict in addition to the two international armed conflicts \u2013 respectively between Israel and Lebanon and between Israel and Syria \u2013 resulting from the use of force by Israel against the territory of Lebanon and Syria and the military occupation of parts of these territories by Israel (see Military occupation of Lebanon by Israel and Military occupation of Syria by Israel).\n\n- **Applicable IHL Law**: The law of military occupation is set forth in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs on Land, in the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Person in Time of War, and the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to International Armed Conflicts. Israel is party to the Geneva Convention (IV), but has not ratified the 1977 Additional Protocol I. Palestine acceded to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1977 Additional Protocol I, and the 1907 Hague Regulations in 2014. Customary international humanitarian law, including the Hague regulations, also applies. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. Based on an extensive study, the International Committee of the Red Cross maintains a database on customary international humanitarian law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Israel is a party to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Israel remains bound by its international human rights law obligations in the territory it occupies.\n\n- **Conflict Parties**: The conflict involves the following parties:\n  - **Palestinian Islamic Jihad** (NonStateActor)\n  - **Hezbollah** (NonStateActor)\n  - **Syrian Arab Republic** (Country, StateActor)\n  - **Israel** (Country, StateActor)\n  - **State of Palestine** (Country, StateActor)\n  - **Lebanon** (Country, StateActor)\n  - **Hamas** (NonStateActor)\n\n- **Conflict Classification**: Military Occupation",

The existence of competing governments and various armed groups has exacerbated the situation. Since 2014, there are overlapping ongoing non-international armed conflicts involving the internationally recognized Government of Libya, Libya National Army (LNA), various armed groups, and intervening foreign powers. The conflicts involve multiple and overlapping non-international armed conflicts with the Government of National Accord (GNA) fighting against the self-declared LNA and affiliated groups loyal to General Haftar, as well as groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State that is gaining control over Derna and Sirte in 2015. The self-declared LNA and affiliated groups loyal to General Haftar, that supports the (HoR) fights against Islamic State and is also engaged in separate conflicts against other armed groups including Derna Protection Force (DPF) and The Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC). Upon request of the UN-backed Government of Libya, the United States launched a sustained air campaign against the Islamic State group in August 2016 and continues to support the GNA. With regard to other foreign interventions, while Turkey is involved in the conflict in support of the GNA, France and United Arab Emirates are involved in NIAC in support of the LNA.\n\nThese conflicts are classified as Non-International Armed Conflicts (NIAC) under international humanitarian law.",

        "Output": "Based on the research data provided, there are 14 Non-International Armed Conflicts (NIACs) occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. Here are the details:\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflicts in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\n1. **Non-international armed conflicts in Ethiopia**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: The Ethiopian central government has been engaging in a non-international armed conflict against the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). Furthermore, Ethiopia was party to a NIAC against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF). It has been reported that Eritrean troops were also fighting against the non-state forces.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n2. **Non-international armed conflicts in the Central African Republic**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Central African Republic (CAR) is involved in a number of non-international armed conflicts against a wide array of non-state actors, in particular ex-S\u00e9l\u00e9ka and anti-Balaka groups. The government is supported by United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Mission (MINUSCA), Rwanda, Wagner group, and previously by France in its efforts to bring peace and stability throughout the country. There are also parallel non-international armed conflicts between different armed groups.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Furthermore, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n3. **Non-international Armed Conflicts in Cameroon**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Cameroon is engaged in a NIAC against Boko Haram in the Far North region. Vigilante groups are also fighting against the non-state actor. However, they are not party to the conflict because they do not meet the organization requirement. Cameroon\u2019s armed forces, including an elite combat unit Rapid Intervention Battalion (RIB), have been involved in NIACs against a number of separatist groups operating in the Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon, in particular the the Ambazonia Governing Council (AGC) and its military wing (the Ambazonia Defense Forces, ADF) and the Interim Government of Ambazonia (IG) and its military wing (the Ambazonia Self-Defence Council, ASC), among others.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n4. **Non-International Armed Conflict in Chad**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: The Chadian Government has been involved in a non-international armed conflict against Boko Haram since 2015. Since January 2015, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) has been active in the fight against Boko Haram. The MNJTF is composed of units from Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n5. **Non-international Armed Conflicts in Nigeria**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: A non-international armed conflict is taking place in Nigeria, involving different actors. The Nigerian Government has been involved in two parallels non-international armed conflicts against respectively Boko Haram, a non-state armed group that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in 2015, and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). Furthermore, there is a NIAC between ISWAP and Boko Haram. Since January 2015, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) has been supporting the Nigerian Government in the fight against Boko Haram. The MNJTF is composed of units from Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Nigeria is also a party to Additional Protocol II applicable to non-international armed conflicts. The ability of Boko Haram and ISWAP to exercise territorial control over parts of Nigeria suggests that they fulfil the required criterion for the applicability of Protocol II, namely the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military operations; impose discipline; and territorial control enabling them (if they were willing) to implement Protocol II. However, Protocol II does not apply between armed groups. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n6. **Non-international armed conflict in South Sudan**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Since December 2013, South Sudan and its armed forces, the former Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), have been involved in parallel non-international armed conflicts with dissident South Sudan armed forces, known as the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army-in-Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) and other armed groups. The August 2015 peace agreement ultimately failed and the non-international armed conflict continues, despite a \u201crevitalized\u201d peace agreement signed in 2018. Furthermore, South Sudan is party to a NIAC against the National Salvation Front (NAS). Uganda was a party to the armed conflict because it had troops fighting alongside the South Sudan armed forces. In accordance with the August 2015 Peace Agreement, Uganda withdrew its forces in October 2015. Accordingly, Uganda is no longer a party to the conflict.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: South Sudan is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. South Sudan is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II applicable to non-international armed conflicts. Although territorial control shifts frequently, the SPLM/A-IO controls territory in South Sudan, which suggests that they fulfil the required criterion for the applicability of Protocol II, namely the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military operations; impose discipline; and the ability to implement Protocol II. It is however unclear, as of June 2019, whether the NAS fulfills the requisite territorial control criterion for the applicability of Protocol II. In any case, Protocol II does not apply to the fighting between the SPLM/A-IO and the NAS as the two entities are non-state armed groups. Common article 3 and customary IHL rules applicable in non-international armed conflicts nonetheless cover the activities of the NAS. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during armed conflicts.\n\n7. **Non-international Armed Conflicts in Mozambique**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Parallel NIACs are taking place in Mozambique: Between 1977 and 1992, Mozambique has been torn by the so-called Mozambiquan civil war, fought between Marxist Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), which was ruling the country at the time, Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO), namely anti-communist insurgents, and a number of smaller groups. In 2013, new tensions emerged between FRELIMO and RENAMO as the latter withdrew from the peace agreement signed in 1992. This led to a new NIAC. While RENAMO and the government signed a peace agreement in 2019, a number of members of the opposition group refused to recognize the agreement and have been carrying out armed attacks against state forces. Since then, a number of RENAMO splinter groups, such as the RENAMO Military Junta, have been fighting against Mozambiquan troops. As a result of the reintegration and demobilization program, there has been a cessation of hostilities between the RENAMO splinter groups and government. Thus, the NIAC has been declassified. Since the end of 2017, in the northern part of the country, notably in Cabo Delgado region, Mozambique has been engaging in a NIAC against the so-called Al-Shabab group, affiliated to the Islamic State (IS). The group has conducted military operations in Tanzania as well. Towards the end of 2019, the NIAC between Mozambique and al-Shabab spilled over and has led to cross-border movement and attacks in Tanzania. Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Southern African Development Community Mission (SAMIM) have been supporting the government in its fight against Islamic State insurgents.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Moreover, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors.\n\n8. **Non-international armed conflicts in Democratic Republic of Congo**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Several non-international armed conflicts are taking place in the DRC involving different non-state and international actors. The Congolese armed forces (FARDC) are party to a number of non-international armed conflicts against, at least, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Mai-Mai Yakutumba, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), M23, and the Cooperative for Development of the Congo (CODECO). The UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) is supporting the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) and is party to the conflicts. Rwanda has intervened in DRC in support of M23. In November 2022, Kenya deployed peacekeeping troops to DRC in order to fight in Goma, as a reaction to alleged support by Rwanda to members of opposition groups in Kivu.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Furthermore, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. DRC is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is bound by customary human rights law. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n9. **Non-international armed conflicts in Mali**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: A number of non-international armed conflicts are taking place in Mali, involving international actors and non-state armed groups: The Government of Mali is engaged in parallel non-international armed conflicts with a number of non-state armed groups, in particular Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State in the Great Sahara (ISGS). Between 2013 and 2022, France provided military support to the Government of Mali in its fight against rebel groups. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) is a peacekeeping operation supporting the Government of Mali in its efforts to restore state control over areas in the hands of non-state armed groups. The Joint Force of the G5 Sahel (FC-G5S) was founded in March 2017 by G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger), with the support of France. Its aim is to counter terrorism and tackling organized crime in the Sahel. Since December 2021, Mali has been supported by by Wagner private military security company (PMSC). Since the interventions are taking place with the consent of the government, the foreign involvement does not affect the classification of the conflict, which remains non-international in character.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Mali is also a party to Additional Protocol II (AP II) applicable to non-international armed conflicts. The ability of certain armed non-state actors to exercise territorial control over parts of Mali suggests that they fulfil the required criterion for the applicability of AP II, namely the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military operations, impose discipline and implement AP II. The Protocol therefore also binds all armed groups fighting against the Malian government, as long as a nexus exists between their fighting and that of groups exercising the required territorial control. All parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n10. **Non-International Armed Conflict in Senegal**\n    - **Conflict Overview**: The Senegalese government is engaged in a non-international armed conflict in Casamance, the southwestern limb of Senegal, with the Mouvement des Forces D\u00e9mocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC), a non-state armed group. The Senegalese armed forces are involved in a decades-old non-international armed conflict with the Mouvement des Forces D\u00e9mocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC). In 1991, the military wing of the MFDC split into two factions: the MFDC-Front Sud and MFDC-Front Nord. Reports indicate that there have been further subdivisions within the military wing of the MFDC because of a limited ability to exercise command and control and a lack of political leadership within the MFDC.\n    - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Though Senegal is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II applicable to non-international armed conflicts, as the MFDC did not exercise such control over a part of Senegal\u2019s territory that would have allowed it to implement Protocol II, the requirement for the applicability of Protocol II is not met. Furthermore, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. Based on an extensive study, the International Committee of the Red Cross maintains a database on customary international humanitarian law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Senegal is also a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is bound by customary human rights law. Under these human rights frameworks, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n11. **Non-international armed conflict in Kenya**\n    - **Conflict Overview**: A non-international armed conflict is taking place between Kenya and al-Shabab in Kenya. Kenyan troops participate to the African Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), former African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is a peacekeeping operation supporting the Somali government. Its military component is a party to the armed conflict. In addition to contributing troops to AMISOM, Kenyan armed forces also operate independently in Somalia to fight against al-Shabab. Therefore, Kenya is also party to the NIAC between al-Shabab and the Somali forces.\n    - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. In addition, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. Based on an extensive study, the International Committee of the Red Cross maintains a database on customary international humanitarian law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Somalia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n12. **Non-international armed conflicts in Niger**\n    - **Conflict Overview**: A number of non-international armed conflicts are taking place in Niger, involving different actors: The Nigerien Government has been involved in parallel non-international armed conflicts, in particular against Boko Haram, a non-state armed group that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in 2015, and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). Since January 2015, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) has been active in the fight against Boko Haram. The MNJTF is composed of units from Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin. French forces have been present in Niger since July 2022, in support of the government.\n    - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n13. **Non-international armed conflict in Somalia**\n    - **Conflict Overview**: A non-international armed conflicts is taking place in Somalia, involving different international actors: The internationally recognized federal government of Somalia fights against Islamist insurgents, most prominently the armed group al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. The African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), previously African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), is a peacekeeping operation supporting the Somali government. Its military component is a party to the armed conflict. In addition to contributing troops to AMISOM, Kenyan and Ethiopian armed forces also operate independently in the country. The United States conducts ground and air operations against al-Shabaab and provides material support to AMISOM and Somali security forces. The non-international armed conflict involving al-Shabaab has spilled over into Kenya.\n    - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. In addition, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Somalia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n14. **Non-international armed conflicts in Burkina Faso**\n    - **Conflict Overview**: A number of parallel NIACs are taking place in Burkina Faso, in particular: Burkina Faso is party to NIACs against at least Ansaroul Islam, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), and the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM). While self-defence groups operate in the country, due to their lack of organization and the low intensity of violence it is not possible to conclude that they are party to NIACs against jihadist groups. France has been militarily active in the country since 2014, when it launched Operation Barkhane with the consent of the Burkinabe government. In light of the number of armed confrontations, especially in recent years, France is party to parallel NIACs against jihadist groups operating in Burkina Faso.\n    - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors.

        "Output": "Based on the research data provided from RULAC, Sudan has been involved in the following conflicts since its independence:\n\n1. **Non-international armed conflicts in Sudan**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: A number of parallel non-international armed conflicts are taking place in Sudan. In Darfur, the Government of Sudan is party to parallel non-international armed conflicts against, at least, two factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army\u2013Abdel Wahid (SLM/A\u2013AW): the SLM/A\u2013AW and the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army\u2013Minni Minnawi (SLM/A\u2013MM). In Kordofan and Blue Nile states, Sudan is party to a non-international armed conflict against, at least, two factions of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army\u2013North (SPLM\u2013North), namely one in the Nuba Mountains led by Abdel Aziz al-Hilu, and the other in White Nile state led by Malik Agar. Since April 2023, the government of Sudan has been engaging in a NIAC against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n   - **Conflict Classification**: Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)\n\n2. **Non-international armed conflicts in Yemen**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: There are currently multiple parallel and overlapping non-international armed conflicts taking place in Yemen, most notably between the government and respectively the Houthis, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Southern Transitional Council, as well as between armed groups. The government is supported by an international coalition led by Saudi Arabia. Multiple parallel and overlapping non-international armed conflicts are taking place in Yemen. First, the longstanding non-international armed conflict between the government and the Houthis continues. During 2015, the Houthis assumed control over Yemen\u2019s capital Sana\u2019a. Upon invitation of Yemen\u2019s President Hadi, an international coalition led by Saudi Arabia intervening since March 2015. The involvement of Saudi Arabia and its allies does not affect the classification as it takes place with the consent of Yemen. Second, the government is also involved in a non-international armed conflict with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. With the apparent consent or cooperation of the Yemen government, the United States has been undertaking targeted operations against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. However, this does not affect the classification of the conflict. Third, armed groups, including the Houthis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are also fighting each other. Finally, the establishment of Southern Transitional Council, in 2017, has led to the surfacing of historical fault lines in Yemen. This resulted in the outbreak of a non-international armed conflict breaking out between the government and the STC.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: Yemen is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Yemen is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II applicable to non-international armed conflicts. The ability of the Houthis and al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula to exercise territorial control over large parts of Yemen suggests that they fulfil the required criterion for the applicability of Protocol II, namely the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military operations; impose discipline; and the ability to implement Protocol II. However, Protocol II does not apply between armed groups. All parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflicts. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n   - **Conflict Classification**: Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)\n\nThese conflicts involve Sudan as a state actor, either directly or through its involvement with other state actors or non-state actors.",
