Israel is recognized as the occupying power in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The occupation has been ongoing since the end of the Six-Day War in 1967. Despite the Oslo Accords, which divided direct authority over the West Bank between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Israel retains effective control over the entire territory. Additionally, Israel withdrew its ground forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but it continues to exercise significant control over the area, maintaining its status as the occupying power.\n\nThe applicable international humanitarian law includes the 1907 Hague Convention (IV), the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV), and customary international humanitarian law. Israel is a party to the Geneva Convention (IV) but has not ratified the 1977 Additional Protocol I. Palestine acceded to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1977 Additional Protocol I, and the 1907 Hague Regulations in 2014.\n\nIn addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Israel is a party to both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and it remains bound by its international human rights law obligations in the territory it occupies.\n\nOther state parties involved in this conflict include the Syrian Arab Republic, Israel, Lebanon, and the State of Palestine. Non-state parties involved include the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, and Hamas.",

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, starting a new phase of the conflict and exercising overall control over separatist groups, turning these NIACs into international armed conflicts.\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflict\n- **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Syria**: Multiple and overlapping NIACs are occurring in Syria. The Syrian Government and its allies, including Russia, are involved in NIACs against several rebel groups. There are also parallel NIACs between various armed groups operating in the territory, as well as NIACs between foreign state forces and armed groups on Syrian territory.\n\n### Military Occupations\n- **Military Occupation of Georgia by Russia**: Russia is the occupying power in areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are internationally recognized as part of Georgia. Russia maintains a military presence in these breakaway regions and exercises control over separatist armed groups.\n- **Military Occupation of Ukraine by Russia**: Since March 2014, Russia has occupied Crimea and, since February 2022, large territories in the south and east of Ukraine. The situation is classified as a military occupation despite alleged consent or referendums.\n- **Military Occupation of Moldova by Russia**: Russia occupies part of Moldovan territory known as Transdniestria. The Operational Group of Russian Forces is stationed there without the consent of Moldova, and Russia exercises control over separatist armed groups in the region.\n\nThese conflicts highlight Russia's involvement in various types of armed conflicts, both international and non-international, as well as military occupations.",

Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n**State Parties Involved:**\nUnited States of America, T\u00fcrkiye, Germany, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Syrian Arab Republic, France, Belgium, Russian Federation, Netherlands (Kingdom of the), United Arab Emirates, Australia\n\n**Non-State Parties Involved:**\nIslamic State group, Hezbollah, Syrian Democratic Forces (including YPG), Ahrar al-Sham, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, The Syrian National Army (SNA), former Free Syrian Army (FSA)",

In August 2021, following the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban rapidly took control of most of the country, including Kabul, and became the effective government of Afghanistan.

        "Output": "Based on the research data provided, the classification of conflicts taking place in Yemen is as follows:\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflicts in Yemen\n\nThe conflicts in Yemen are classified as non-international armed conflicts (NIAC). There are multiple parallel and overlapping non-international armed conflicts occurring in the country. The primary conflicts involve:\n\n1. **The Government and the Houthis**: This longstanding conflict has seen the Houthis assume control over Yemen\u2019s capital, Sana\u2019a. An international coalition led by Saudi Arabia has been intervening since March 2015 with the consent of Yemen\u2019s President Hadi.\n\n2. **The Government and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula**: The government is engaged in a conflict with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The United States has been undertaking targeted operations against al-Qaeda with the apparent consent or cooperation of the Yemeni government.\n\n3. **Armed Groups Fighting Each Other**: Various armed groups, including the Houthis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, are engaged in conflicts with each other.\n\n4. **The Government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC)**: The establishment of the STC in 2017 led to historical fault lines surfacing, resulting in a non-international armed conflict between the government and the STC.\n\n### Applicable International Humanitarian Law\n\nYemen is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, and all parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to these conventions. This article provides for the minimum standard of humane treatment without adverse distinction for all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking, and unfair trials.\n\nYemen is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II, which is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. The ability of the Houthis and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to exercise territorial control over large parts of Yemen suggests that they fulfill the required criteria for the applicability of Protocol II. However, Protocol II does not apply between armed groups. All parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflicts.\n\nIn addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n### State Parties Involved\n\nThe state parties involved in the conflicts in Yemen include:\n\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Kuwait\n- Bahrain\n- United Arab Emirates\n- United States of America\n- Egypt\n- Sudan\n- Yemen\n- Jordan\n\n### Non-State Parties Involved\n\nThe non-state parties involved in the conflicts include:\n\n- Houthis\n- Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\n- Southern Transitional Council (STC)\n\nThis classification is based on the factual circumstances and relevant legal criteria, and it is an objective determination that does not depend on the subjective will of the parties to the conflict.",

        "Output": "According to the data provided, there is currently one distinct armed conflict taking place in Nigeria. This conflict is classified as a **Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)**.\n\n### Conflict Details:\n\n**Non-International Armed Conflicts in Nigeria**\n\nThe Nigerian Government is involved in two parallel non-international armed conflicts against Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). Additionally, there is a non-international armed conflict between ISWAP and Boko Haram. Since January 2015, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), composed of units from Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, and Benin, has been supporting the Nigerian Government in the fight against Boko Haram.\n\nAll parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking, and unfair trials. Nigeria is also a party to Additional Protocol II applicable to non-international armed conflicts. The ability of Boko Haram and ISWAP to exercise territorial control over parts of Nigeria suggests that they fulfill the required criterion for the applicability of Protocol II, namely the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military operations; impose discipline; and territorial control enabling them (if they were willing) to implement Protocol II. However, Protocol II does not apply between armed groups. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.",

In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, marking a new phase of the conflict. The NIACs turned into IACs as Russia started exercising overall control over these groups. Currently, Russia is occupying several regions of Ukraine, including Crimea.\n   - **Applicable International Humanitarian Law**: Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocol I. They are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. Additionally, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n   - **State Parties**: Ukraine, Russian Federation\n   - **Non-State Parties**: Russian-backed militias, Ukrainian separatist groups\n\n2. **Military Occupation of Ukraine by Russia**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Since March 2014, Russia has been occupying Crimea. Additionally, Russia has been occupying large territories in the south and the east of Ukraine since February 2022. The alleged consent for Russian intervention and the Crimean referendum do not alter the status of Crimea as a military occupation.\n   - **Applicable International Humanitarian Law**: The law of military occupation applies to the occupied territory of Crimea, as set forth in Articles 42 to 56 of the 1907 Hague Regulations, the fourth 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to international armed conflicts. Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the 1977 Additional Protocol I and are bound by customary international humanitarian law. International human rights law also applies, with the occupying power obliged to secure the European Convention on Human Rights.\n   - **State Parties**: Ukraine, Russian Federation\n   - **Non-State Parties**: No non-state actors recorded\n\nThese conflicts highlight the complex and evolving nature of the situation in Ukraine, involving both international armed conflicts and military occupations.",

        "Output": "### Conflicts in Nigeria\n\nAccording to the data provided, there is currently one distinct armed conflict taking place in Nigeria. This conflict is classified as a **Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)**.\n\n#### Conflict Details\n\n**Conflict Name:** Non-International Armed Conflicts in Nigeria\n\n**Conflict Overview:**\nThe Nigerian Government is involved in two parallel non-international armed conflicts against Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). Additionally, there is a non-international armed conflict between ISWAP and Boko Haram. Since January 2015, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), composed of units from Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, and Benin, has been supporting the Nigerian Government in the fight against Boko Haram.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nAll parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Nigeria is also a party to Additional Protocol II applicable to non-international armed conflicts. The ability of Boko Haram and ISWAP to exercise territorial control over parts of Nigeria suggests that they fulfill the required criterion for the applicability of Protocol II, namely the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military operations; impose discipline; and territorial control enabling them (if they were willing) to implement Protocol II. However, Protocol II does not apply between armed groups. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n**State Parties:**\n- Benin\n- Cameroon\n- Chad\n- Niger\n- Nigeria\n\n**Non-State Parties:**\n- Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP)\n- Boko Haram\n\n**Conflict Classification:** Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)",

        "Output": "Based on the provided research data from RULAC, we can analyze the most common causes of conflicts in African Union (AU) states compared to European Union (EU) states.\n\n### African Union States\n\nThe African Union states are involved in a variety of conflicts, primarily non-international armed conflicts (NIACs). The most common causes of these conflicts include:\n\n1. **Internal Political Instability and Armed Groups**: Many AU states are engaged in conflicts with various non-state armed groups. For example:\n   - **Libya**: Involved in multiple NIACs with different armed groups and intervening foreign powers.\n   - **Somalia**: Engaged in NIACs against Islamist insurgents like al-Shabaab.\n   - **Niger**: Involved in NIACs against Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n   - **Burkina Faso**: Engaged in NIACs against multiple jihadist groups.\n\n2. **Territorial Disputes and Separatist Movements**: Some conflicts involve separatist groups or territorial disputes. For example:\n   - **Mali**: Engaged in NIACs with groups like JNIM and ISGS.\n   - **Cameroon**: Involved in NIACs against separatist groups in the Northwest and Southwest regions.\n\n3. **Military Occupations**: There are instances of military occupations, such as:\n   - **Western Sahara**: Occupied by Morocco, with the Polisario Front seeking self-determination.\n\n### European Union States\n\nThe European Union states are involved in fewer conflicts compared to AU states, and these conflicts are often international armed conflicts (IACs) or interventions in other regions. The most common causes include:\n\n1. **Interventions in Foreign Conflicts**: EU states are often involved in conflicts outside their territory, supporting other governments or coalitions. For example:\n   - **Syria**: Multiple EU states are involved in IACs and NIACs, supporting various factions or coalitions.\n   - **Libya**: EU states like France and Italy are involved in supporting different factions in the NIACs.\n\n2. **Military Occupations**: There are instances of military occupations, such as:\n   - **Cyprus**: Occupied by Turkey, with the EU member state Cyprus being a party to the conflict.\n\n### Comparison\n\n- **AU States**: Primarily involved in NIACs due to internal political instability, armed groups, and separatist movements. Military occupations are also a factor.\n- **EU States**: Primarily involved in IACs or interventions in foreign conflicts, supporting other governments or coalitions. Military occupations are less common but still present.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most common causes of conflicts in African Union states are internal political instability and armed groups, along with territorial disputes and separatist movements. In contrast, European Union states are more commonly involved in interventions in foreign conflicts and military occupations. This reflects the different geopolitical dynamics and internal challenges faced by these regions.",

It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking, and unfair trials.\n- **Customary International Humanitarian Law**: This consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law, applicable to non-international armed conflicts.\n- **International Human Rights Law**: This continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\nAdditionally, for the conflict in Nigeria, **Additional Protocol II** is applicable to non-international armed conflicts. The ability of Boko Haram and ISWAP to exercise territorial control over parts of Nigeria suggests that they fulfill the required criterion for the applicability of Protocol II, namely the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military operations, impose discipline, and territorial control enabling them (if they were willing) to implement Protocol II. However, Protocol II does not apply between armed groups.\n\nThese frameworks ensure that all parties to the conflict are bound by specific legal obligations to protect civilians and other non-combatants, and to conduct hostilities in a manner that respects international law.",

This conflict has evolved significantly over time and is notable for its longevity and complexity.\n\n### Conflict Overview\n\nColombia has experienced one of the longest non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) in modern times. The Government of Colombia is currently involved in parallel NIACs against two main non-state actors:\n\n1. **Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (National Liberation Army) (ELN)**\n2. **FARC-EP dissident group (Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc))**\n\n### Applicable International Humanitarian Law\n\nColombia is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions, which means all parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to these conventions. This article provides minimum standards for humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage-taking, and unfair trials.\n\nAdditionally, Colombia is a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II (AP II) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. This protocol is applicable to NIACs taking place in the territory of a High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups. These groups must exercise control over a part of the territory to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and implement this protocol.\n\n### Customary International Humanitarian Law\n\nAll parties to the conflict are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflicts.\n\n### International Human Rights Law\n\nIn addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. The territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including those by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n### State and Non-State Parties\n\n- **State Party:** Colombia\n- **Non-State Parties:** National Liberation Army (ELN), The former Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc) of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia\u2013Ej\u00e9rcito del Pueblo (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People\u2019s Army) (FARC-EP)\n\n### Conflict Classification\n\nThe conflict is classified as a **Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)**.\n\nThis overview provides a snapshot of the complex and evolving nature of the armed conflicts in Colombia, highlighting the involvement of various non-state actors and the applicable legal frameworks that govern these conflicts.",

Key events include:\n\n- **2002**: Pakistan began military operations against foreign fighters in its tribal areas.\n- **2004**: Pakistan launched offensives against fighters believed to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, with the United States conducting drone strikes in the same area.\n- **2014**: Pakistan initiated a significant counter-terrorism operation, Zarb-e-Azb, against various non-state armed groups.\n\nIn parallel, there are armed groups fighting for the independence of the province of Balochistan, adding another layer to the conflict.\n\n### Applicable International Humanitarian Law\n\nAll parties to the conflict, including the Taliban and other non-state actors, are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.

The non-international armed conflict against the PKK also spills over into Syria and Iraq, where Turkish actions are intertwined with the ongoing non-international armed conflicts in those countries. Due to the Turkish use of force on Iraqi and Syrian territory and the occupation of parts of the latter without the consent of the territorial states, the spillover of the non-international armed conflict in T\u00fcrkiye also leads to parallel international armed conflicts with Iraq and Syria.\n\nBoth T\u00fcrkiye and the PKK are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage-taking, and unfair trials. In addition, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflicts. T\u00fcrkiye is also a state party to the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Convention, which prohibits the use of anti-personnel mines and requires their destruction in mined areas under its jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including those by non-state actors.",

        "Output": "Based on the provided research data from RULAC, the Islamic State (ISIS) has been involved in several non-international armed conflicts (NIACs). Here is an overview of these conflicts and how the role of ISIS has evolved over time:\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflicts Involving ISIS\n\n1. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Libya**\n   - **Overview**: After the fall of the Qaddafi regime in 2011, Libya has been in a state of political unrest and armed violence. ISIS has been one of the key non-state actors involved in these conflicts.\n   - **Role of ISIS**: ISIS gained control over Derna and Sirte in 2015. The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) has been engaged in a NIAC with ISIS, with support from the United States launching a sustained air campaign against ISIS in August 2016.\n\n2. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Syria**\n   - **Overview**: Syria has multiple and overlapping NIACs involving various rebel groups and foreign state forces.\n   - **Role of ISIS**: The Syrian Government and its allies are involved in NIACs against ISIS, among other groups. There are also parallel NIACs between foreign state forces and ISIS, including a NIAC between the US-led coalition and ISIS.\n\n3. **Non-International Armed Conflict in Somalia**\n   - **Overview**: The conflict involves the internationally recognized federal government of Somalia fighting against Islamist insurgents, including al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda.\n   - **Role of ISIS**: The conflict involving al-Shabaab has spilled over into Kenya, and the United States conducts ground and air operations against al-Shabaab.\n\n4. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Niger**\n   - **Overview**: Niger is involved in parallel NIACs against Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n   - **Role of ISIS**: ISWAP, an affiliate of ISIS, is one of the key non-state armed groups involved in the conflicts.\n\n5. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Iraq**\n   - **Overview**: The Iraqi government is involved in a NIAC against the Islamic State group and associated groups, with support from an international coalition led by the United States.\n   - **Role of ISIS**: The Iraqi government, with the support of an international coalition, initiated airstrikes targeting ISIS in August 2014. By late 2022, the U.S. Coalition shifted into an advisory and assistance role, marking the end of the NIAC against ISIS in Iraq.\n\n6. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Pakistan**\n   - **Overview**: Pakistan has multiple and overlapping armed conflicts, including those that have spilled over into Afghanistan.\n   - **Role of ISIS**: The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan group (TTP) and other armed groups are involved in conflicts with the Pakistani government. The United States has targeted suspected al-Qaeda members in the area through drone strikes.\n\n7. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Burkina Faso**\n   - **Overview**: Burkina Faso is involved in parallel NIACs against several jihadist groups, including Ansaroul Islam and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS).\n   - **Role of ISIS**: ISGS, an affiliate of ISIS, is one of the key non-state armed groups involved in the conflicts.\n\n8. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in the Philippines**\n   - **Overview**: The Government of the Philippines is involved in multiple NIACs against various armed groups, including the Abu Sayyaf Group.\n   - **Role of ISIS**: The Abu Sayyaf Group, which has pledged allegiance to ISIS, is one of the non-state armed groups involved in the conflicts.\n\n9. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Mali**\n   - **Overview**: Mali is involved in parallel NIACs against several non-state armed groups, including Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS).\n   - **Role of ISIS**: ISGS, an affiliate of ISIS, is one of the key non-state armed groups involved in the conflicts.\n\n10. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Afghanistan**\n    - **Overview**: Afghanistan has been affected by multiple and overlapping NIACs, including those involving the Taliban and the Islamic State-Khorasan province (IS-KP).\n    - **Role of ISIS**: IS-KP, an affiliate of ISIS, is involved in a NIAC with the Taliban government.\n\n11. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Nigeria**\n    - **Overview**: Nigeria is involved in parallel NIACs against Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n    - **Role of ISIS**: ISWAP, an affiliate of ISIS, is one of the key non-state armed groups involved in the conflicts.\n\n### Changes in the Role of ISIS Over Time\n\n- **Expansion and Control**: In several conflicts, ISIS and its affiliates have gained control over territories, such as in Libya and Syria. This control has often led to sustained military operations by international coalitions and local governments.\n- **Shift in Conflict Dynamics**: In some cases, the role of ISIS has shifted due to changes in the conflict dynamics. For example, in Iraq, the international coalition's role shifted from active airstrikes to advisory and assistance roles, marking a change in the nature of the conflict against ISIS.\n- **Affiliate Groups**: ISIS has expanded its influence through affiliate groups, such as ISWAP in Niger and Nigeria, ISGS in Burkina Faso and Mali, and IS-KP in Afghanistan. These affiliates have played significant roles in the respective conflicts.\n- **International Interventions**: The involvement of ISIS has often led to international interventions, with countries like the United States, France, and others providing military support to local governments against ISIS and its affiliates.\n\nIn summary, ISIS and its affiliates have been key players in multiple non-international armed conflicts, with their roles evolving due to changes in control, conflict dynamics, and international interventions.",

Ceasefire violations and border skirmishes have increased since 2013.\n   - **Applicable Law**: Both India and Pakistan are party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and are bound by customary international humanitarian law.\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflict\n1. **Non-International Armed Conflict in India**\n   - **Overview**: The Government of India is involved in a conflict with the Communist Party of India-Maoist (Naxalites). There is also a non-international armed conflict between India and separatist groups in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).\n   - **Applicable Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standard of humane treatment. They are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflicts. Additionally, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\nThese conflicts highlight the complex nature of armed violence in the region, involving both international and non-international dimensions.",

The situation is classified as a military occupation despite alleged consent from ousted President Yanukovych and a referendum in Crimea, as these do not affect the legal status of the occupation.\n   - **Applicable Law**: The law of military occupation applies, as set forth in the 1907 Hague Regulations, the fourth 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the 1977 Additional Protocol I. Both Russia and Ukraine are bound by these laws and customary international humanitarian law. International human rights law also applies.\n   - **Parties Involved**: Ukraine and the Russian Federation.\n\n2. **International Armed Conflict in Ukraine**\n   - **Overview**: This conflict has been ongoing since February 2014, initially involving both international and non-international armed conflicts. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, marking a new phase in the conflict. The non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) between Ukraine and separatist groups turned into international armed conflicts (IACs) as Russia began exercising overall control over these groups.\n   - **Applicable Law**: Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocol I. They are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. International human rights law continues to apply during the conflict.\n   - **Parties Involved**: Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Russian-backed militias, and Ukrainian separatist groups.\n\nThese conflicts highlight the complex and evolving nature of the situation in Ukraine, involving both military occupation and international armed conflict.",

The conflicts have also spilled over into Afghanistan. In 2002, Pakistan began conducting military operations against foreign fighters hiding in its tribal areas. In response to these attacks, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan group (TTP) formed out of veterans of armed conflicts in neighboring countries, such as Afghanistan, and local tribal groups. In 2004, Pakistan began launching military offensives against fighters believed to be affiliated to al-Qaeda in the tribal areas near its Afghan border. The United States simultaneously began targeting suspected al-Qaeda members in the same area through drone strikes. Further offensives were launched in subsequent years. In 2014, Pakistan launched a \u2018counter-terrorism\u2019 operation, Zarb-e-Azb, against various non-state armed groups. In parallel, armed groups are fighting the government over independence of the province of Balochistan.",

T\u00fcrkiye is occupying parts of northern Syria and has been conducting military operations against the Islamic State and Kurdish groups since 2016 without the consent of the Syrian government.\n   - **Applicable Law**: Syria, T\u00fcrkiye, the United States, and other members of the coalition are party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. Several countries, including Syria, are also party to the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to international armed conflicts. All parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts.\n\n2. **International Armed Conflict in Iraq**:\n   - **Overview**: There is an international armed conflict between T\u00fcrkiye and Iraq due to ongoing airstrikes by T\u00fcrkiye targeting the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) in northern Iraq without the consent of the Iraqi government. This conflict is an extension of the ongoing non-international armed conflict in T\u00fcrkiye between Turkish armed and security forces and the PKK.\n   - **Applicable Law**: Both Iraq and T\u00fcrkiye are party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. Iraq is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to international armed conflicts. Both countries are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts.\n\nThese conflicts highlight the complex nature of contemporary armed conflicts, involving multiple state and non-state actors and requiring careful legal classification under international humanitarian law.",

Despite the Oslo Accords, which divided direct authority over the West Bank between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, Israel retains effective control over the entire territory. Although Israel withdrew its ground forces from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it continues to be recognized as the occupying power due to the level of control it still exercises over the region.\n\n**Applicable IHL Law:**\nThe law of military occupation is set forth in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex, the 1949 Geneva Convention (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, and the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to International Armed Conflicts.

Notably, the Government of Colombia is still involved in parallel NIACs against the Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (National Liberation Army) (ELN) and the FARC-EP dissident group (Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc)).\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nColombia is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage-taking, and unfair trials.\n\nColombia is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II (AP II) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. According to Article 1, AP II, this treaty is applicable to NIACs taking place \u2018in the territory of a High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups which, under responsible command, exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement this Protocol\u2019. As discussed in the classification section, a number of non-state actors have an established command structure and control a considerable amount of the Colombian territory, hence AP II is applicable to the fight that involve these groups.\n\nMoreover, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict.\n\nIn addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas, such as the AGC.\n\n**State Parties:**\nColombia\n\n**Non-State Parties:**\n- National Liberation Army (ELN)\n- The former Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc) of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia\u2013 Eje\u0301rcito del Pueblo (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People\u2019s Army) (FARC-EP)",

In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of occupation. Both T\u00fcrkiye and Cyprus are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights.

Notably, the Government of Colombia is still involved in parallel NIACs against the Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (National Liberation Army) (ELN) and the FARC-EP dissident group (Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc)).\n\n**Applicable IHL Law:**\nColombia is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage-taking, and unfair trials.\n\nColombia is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II (AP II) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. According to Article 1, AP II, this treaty is applicable to NIACs taking place \u2018in the territory of a High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups which, under responsible command, exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement this Protocol\u2019. As discussed in the classification section, a number of non-state actors have an established command structure and control a considerable amount of the Colombian territory, hence AP II is applicable to the fight that involve these groups.\n\nMoreover, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict.\n\nIn addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas, such as the AGC.\n\n**State Parties:**\nColombia\n\n**Non-State Parties:**\nNational Liberation Army (ELN), The former Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc) of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia\u2013 Eje\u0301rcito del Pueblo (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People\u2019s Army) (FARC-EP)\n\n**Conflict Classification:**\nNon-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)",

This conflict is classified as a **Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)**.\n\n### Conflict Details:\n**Conflict Name:** Non-international armed conflicts in Libya\n\n**Overview:**\nAfter the fall of the Qaddafi regime in 2011, Libya has experienced continuous political unrest and armed violence. The situation is complicated by the presence of competing governments and a multitude of armed groups that frequently switch alliances and operate autonomously. Since 2014, there have been overlapping non-international armed conflicts involving the internationally recognized Government of Libya, the Libyan National Army (LNA), various armed groups, and intervening foreign powers.\n\nKey points include:\n- The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) is engaged in conflicts with the self-declared LNA and groups loyal to General Haftar, who are aligned with the House of Representatives (HoR).\n- The GNA is also fighting against groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, which gained control over Derna and Sirte in 2015.\n- The LNA and its affiliated groups are fighting against the Islamic State and other armed groups, including the Derna Protection Force (DPF) and the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC).\n- Foreign interventions include the United States launching an air campaign against the Islamic State in 2016, with Turkey supporting the GNA, and France and the United Arab Emirates supporting the LNA.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nLibya is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II, which applies to non-international armed conflicts. All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions, which sets minimum standards for humane treatment and prohibits acts such as murder, torture, and unfair trials. Customary international humanitarian law also applies, and international human rights law continues to be relevant during the conflict.\n\n**State Parties Involved:**\n- United States of America\n- United Arab Emirates\n- France\n- T\u00fcrkiye\n- Libya\n\n**Non-State Parties Involved:**\n- Libyan National Army\n- Derna Protection Force (DPF)\n- The Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC)\n- Islamic State group",

The African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), previously known as AMISOM, is a peacekeeping operation supporting the Somali government. In addition to contributing troops to AMISOM, Kenyan and Ethiopian armed forces also operate independently in the country. The United States conducts ground and air operations against al-Shabaab and provides material support to AMISOM and Somali security forces. The conflict involving al-Shabaab has spilled over into Kenya.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nAll parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking, and unfair trials. Additionally, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. International human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n#### Non-International Armed Conflicts in Ethiopia\n\n**State Actors Involved:**\n- Ethiopia\n\n**Non-State Actors Involved:**\n- Oromo Liberation Army (OLA)\n- Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)\n\n**Overview:**\nThe Ethiopian central government has been engaging in a non-international armed conflict against the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). Furthermore, Ethiopia was party to a non-international armed conflict against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF). It has been reported that Eritrean troops were also fighting against the non-state forces.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nAll parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking, and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. International human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\nThese conflicts highlight the complex nature of armed violence in the Horn of Africa, involving both state and non-state actors and requiring adherence to international humanitarian law.",

Notably, the Government of Colombia is still involved in parallel NIACs against the Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (National Liberation Army) (ELN) and the FARC-EP dissident group (Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc)).\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nColombia is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage-taking and unfair trials.\n\nColombia is also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol II (AP II) to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. According to Article 1, AP II, this treaty is applicable to NIACs taking place \u2018in the territory of a High Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups which, under responsible command, exercise such control over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted military operations and to implement this Protocol\u2019. As discussed in the classification section, a number of non-state actors have an established command structure and control a considerable amount of the Colombian territory, hence AP II is applicable to the fight that involve these groups.\n\nMoreover, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict.\n\nIn addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas, such as the AGC.\n\n**State Parties:**\nColombia\n\n**Non-State Parties:**\nNational Liberation Army (ELN), The former Bloque Oriental (Eastern Bloc) of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia\u2013 Eje\u0301rcito del Pueblo (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - People\u2019s Army) (FARC-EP)",

        "Output": "### Conflicts in the Horn of Africa\n\nAccording to the RULAC (Rule of Law in Armed Conflict) data, there are currently two distinct armed conflicts taking place in the Horn of Africa region, which includes the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Here is a breakdown by country:\n\n#### Ethiopia\n- **Conflict Name:** Non-international armed conflicts in Ethiopia\n- **Conflict Overview:** The Ethiopian central government has been engaging in a non-international armed conflict against the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). Furthermore, Ethiopia was party to a NIAC against the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF). It has been reported that Eritrean troops were also fighting against the non-state forces.\n- **Applicable IHL Law:** All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n- **State Parties:** Ethiopia\n- **Non-State Parties:** Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)\n\n#### Somalia\n- **Conflict Name:** Non-international armed conflict in Somalia\n- **Conflict Overview:** A non-international armed conflict is taking place in Somalia, involving different international actors. The internationally recognized federal government of Somalia fights against Islamist insurgents, most prominently the armed group al-Shabaab, which has pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda. The African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), previously African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), is a peacekeeping operation supporting the Somali government. Its military component is a party to the armed conflict. In addition to contributing troops to AMISOM, Kenyan and Ethiopian armed forces also operate independently in the country. The United States conducts ground and air operations against al-Shabaab and provides material support to AMISOM and Somali security forces. The non-international armed conflict involving al-Shabaab has spilled over into Kenya.\n- **Applicable IHL Law:** All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. In addition, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Somalia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n- **State Parties:** Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, United States of America\n- **Non-State Parties:** Islamic State in Somalia (ISS), Al-Shabaab, African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)",

According to the RULAC (Rule of Law in Armed Conflict) project, Hamas is a non-state actor involved in the following conflicts:\n\n1. **Military Occupation of Palestine by Israel**\n   - **Classification**: Military Occupation\n   - **Overview**: Israel is occupying the territory of Palestine. Israel is internationally recognized as the occupying power in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Israel has occupied these territories since the end of the Six-Day War in 1967.\n   - **Parties Involved**: Israel, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah\n\n### Conflict Classifications\n\n- **International Armed Conflict (IAC)**: The conflict between Israel and Hamas, as well as the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah and between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, are classified as international armed conflicts. This classification is based on the criteria that there is a resort to armed force between states or protracted armed violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between such groups within a state.\n\n- **Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)**: The clashes between Israel and Hezbollah are also classified as non-international armed conflicts. This classification is based on the criteria that there must be protracted armed violence and at least one side to the conflict is an organized armed group.\n\n### Summary\n\nHamas has been involved in conflicts primarily within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The conflicts involving Hamas are classified as both international and non-international armed conflicts, depending on the specific circumstances and the parties involved.",

Furthermore, the Philippine Armed Forces are engaged in a non-international armed conflict against the New People\u2019s Army.\n- **Applicable IHL Law:** All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n- **State Parties:** Philippines\n- **Conflict Classification:** Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)\n- **Non-State Parties:** Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Abu Sayyaf Group, Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), New People\u2019s Army (NPA), Maute Group",

        "Output": "Based on the research data provided, here are the conflicts concerning Russia and the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) applicable to them:\n\n### International Armed Conflict in Ukraine\n- **Conflict Overview**: Between February 2014 and February 2022, there have been an IAC between Russia and Ukraine and parallel NIACs between Ukraine and separatist groups in the east of the country. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, hence starting a new phase of the conflict. Nevertheless, these NIACs turned into IACs in February 2022, as Russia started exercising overall control over such groups. Currently, Russia is occupying a number of regions of Ukraine, Crimea included.\n- **Applicable IHL**: Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocol I. In addition, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. International human rights law also continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n### Military Occupation of Ukraine by Russia\n- **Conflict Overview**: Since March 2014, Crimea has been occupied by Russia. Furthermore, Russia has been occupying large territories in the south and the east of Ukraine since February 2022.\n- **Applicable IHL**: Under the law of occupation, an occupation is supposed to be temporary and does not alter the status of the territory in question. The occupying power does not enjoy sovereign rights over the territory in question. The law of military occupation applies to the occupied territory of Crimea. The law of military occupation is set forth in Articles 42 to 56 in the 1907 Hague Regulations, the fourth 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to international armed conflicts. Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the 1977 Additional Protocol I. In addition, both Russia and Ukraine are bound by customary international humanitarian law. International human rights law also applies.\n\n### Military Occupation of Georgia by Russia\n- **Conflict Overview**: Russia is the occupying power in areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are internationally recognised as forming part of Georgia. Russia maintains military presence in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the basis of agreements concluded with these entities without the consent of Georgia. While Russia and few other States recognize these entities as independent States, an overwhelming majority of States considers them as part of an internationally recognized territory of Georgia. Russia also exercises its authority over these regions by its overall control over the separatist armed groups.\n- **Applicable IHL**: The law of military occupation is set out in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs on Land, the 1949 Geneva Conventions (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilians Persons in Time of War and the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to International Armed Conflict. Both Georgia and Russia are parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and 1977 Additional Protocol I. Customary international humanitarian law is also applicable during occupation, it complements the protection granted by treaties and binds all parties to the conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of occupation. Both Russia and Georgia are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights. Russia remains bound by its international human rights law obligations in the territory it occupies.\n\n### Military Occupation of Moldova by Russia\n- **Conflict Overview**: Russia occupies part of Moldovan territory. The Russian occupation extends over a strip of land on the east bank of Moldova\u2019s Dniester River, known as Transdniestria. Russia is the occupying power in the Moldovan territory of Transdniestria. The Operational Group of Russian Forces (OGRF) \u2013 formerly the 14th Army of the military district of Odessa of the Ministry of Defence of the USSR (14th Army) \u2013 is stationed in Transdniestria without the consent of the Republic of Moldova. The OGRF numbers between 1,500 and 2,000 Russian soldiers with significant stockpiles of weapons and ammunition. Russia also exercises overall control over the separatist armed groups of Transdniestria, i.e. the self-proclaimed \u2018Moldovan Republic of Transdniestria.\u2019 In other words, Russia is also using proxy forces.\n- **Applicable IHL**: The law of military occupation is set forth in the 1907 Hague Convention (IV) Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and its Annex: Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs on Land, the 1949 Geneva Conventions (IV) Relative to the Protection of Civilians Persons in Time of War and the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to International Armed Conflicts. Both Moldova and Russia are a party to the 1949 Convention, and the 1977 Additional Protocol I. Customary international humanitarian law is also applicable during occupation; it complements the protection granted by treaties and binds all parties to the conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of occupation. Both Russia and Moldova are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights. Russia remains bound by its international human rights law obligations in the territory it occupies.\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflicts in Syria\n- **Conflict Overview**: Multiple and overlapping non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) occurring in Syria. The Syrian Government and its allies are involved in NIACs against several rebel groups, including the Syrian National Army, Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamic State group, the Syrian Democratic Forces and other smaller armed groups. Furthermore, there are also parallel NIACs between those armed groups operating in the territory. Finally, multiple NIACs are taking place between foreign state forces and armed groups on Syrian territory: two parallel NIACs between the US-led coalition on the one hand, and the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda on the other hand; two NIACs between T\u00fcrkiye and respectively the Islamic State and Kurdish militia and, finally, a NIAC between Israel and Hezbollah.\n- **Applicable IHL**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. All parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.",

According to the RULAC project, the following conflicts are taking place in the Sahel region:\n\n1. **Non-international armed conflicts in Mali**\n   - **Overview**: A number of non-international armed conflicts are taking place in Mali, involving international actors and non-state armed groups. The Government of Mali is engaged in parallel non-international armed conflicts with a number of non-state armed groups, in particular Jama\u2019at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and the Islamic State in the Great Sahara (ISGS). France has provided military support to the Government of Mali, and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) is a peacekeeping operation supporting the Government of Mali. The Joint Force of the G5 Sahel (FC-G5S) was founded in March 2017 by G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger), with the support of France. Since December 2021, Mali has been supported by Wagner private military security company (PMSC).\n\n2. **Non-international armed conflicts in Burkina Faso**\n   - **Overview**: A number of parallel NIACs are taking place in Burkina Faso, in particular against Ansaroul Islam, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), and the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM). France has been militarily active in the country since 2014, when it launched Operation Barkhane with the consent of the Burkinabe government.\n\n3. **Non-International Armed Conflict in Senegal**\n   - **Overview**: The Senegalese government is engaged in a non-international armed conflict in Casamance, the southwestern limb of Senegal, with the Mouvement des Forces D\u00e9mocratiques de la Casamance (MFDC).\n\n4. **Non-International Armed Conflict in Chad**\n   - **Overview**: The Chadian Government has been involved in a non-international armed conflict against Boko Haram since 2015. Since January 2015, the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) has been active in the fight against Boko Haram.\n\n5. **Non-International Armed Conflicts in Niger**\n   - **Overview**: A number of non-international armed conflicts are taking place in Niger, involving different actors. The Nigerien Government has been involved in parallel non-international armed conflicts, in particular against Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). French forces have been present in Niger since July 2022, in support of the government.\n\n6. **Non-international armed conflicts in Sudan**\n   - **Overview**: A number of parallel non-international armed conflicts are taking place in Sudan. In Darfur, the Government of Sudan is party to parallel non-international armed conflicts against, at least, two factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army\u2013Abdel Wahid (SLM/A\u2013AW). In Kordofan and Blue Nile states, Sudan is party to a non-international armed conflict against, at least, two factions of the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement/Army\u2013North (SPLM\u2013North). Since April 2023, the government of Sudan has been engaging in a NIAC against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).\n\nThese conflicts are classified as Non-International Armed Conflicts (NIAC) and involve various state and non-state actors.",

        "Output": "Based on the research data provided from RULAC, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is currently associated with the following conflicts as a state actor:\n\n1. **Non-international Armed Conflict in Democratic Republic of the Congo**\n   - **Overview**: Several non-international armed conflicts are taking place in the DRC involving different non-state and international actors. The Congolese armed forces (FARDC) are party to a number of non-international armed conflicts against, at least, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Mai-Mai Yakutumba, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), M23, and the Cooperative for Development of the Congo (CODECO). The UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) is supporting the Congolese Armed Forces (FARDC) and is party to the conflicts. Rwanda has intervened in DRC in support of M23. In November 2022, Kenya deployed peacekeeping troops to DRC in order to fight in Goma, as a reaction to alleged support by Rwanda to members of opposition groups in Kivu.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for minimum standards to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active part in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. Furthermore, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. DRC is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Furthermore, it is bound by customary human rights law. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n2. **International Armed Conflict in Democratic Republic of the Congo**\n   - **Overview**: The Democratic Republic of Congo is engaged in a non-international armed conflict against the M23 armed group. Rwanda has intervened in DRC in support of M23, both by aiding the group and by deploying its own troops, hence triggering an international armed conflict.\n   - **Applicable IHL Law**: Both countries are parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and to the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to international armed conflicts. Furthermore, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict, but it is controversial whether it also applies to extra-territorial airstrikes.\n\nThese conflicts involve various state and non-state actors, including Rwanda, Kenya, and several non-state armed groups.",

        "Output": "Based on the research data provided from RULAC, Russia is involved in the following conflicts as a state party:\n\n1. **International Armed Conflict in Ukraine**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Between February 2014 and February 2022, there have been an IAC between Russia and Ukraine and parallel NIACs between Ukraine and separatist groups in the east of the country. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, hence starting a new phase of the conflict. Nevertheless, these NIACs turned into IACs in February 2022, as Russia started exercising overall control over such groups. Currently, Russia is occupying a number of regions of Ukraine, Crimea included.\n\n2. **Military Occupation of Ukraine by Russia**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Since March 2014, Crimea has been occupied by Russia. Furthermore, Russia has been occupying large territories in the south and the east of Ukraine since February 2022. Since March 2014, Russia has been occupying part of Ukrainian territory, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol ('Crimea'). The alleged consent for a Russian intervention, based on a request by ousted President Yanukovych, does not affect the classification of the situation as a military occupation. Similarly, the Crimean referendum of 16 March 2014 to join Russia did not alter the status of Crimea in light of the fact that he was ousted by the parliament. In addition, Russia has been occupying large territories in the south and the east of Ukraine since February 2022. The alleged request for assistance from the People's Republics in the Donbass does not constitute valid consent, and therefore does not alter the qualification of the situation as military occupation.\n\n3. **Military Occupation of Georgia by Russia**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Russia is the occupying power in areas of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which are internationally recognised as forming part of Georgia. Russia maintains military presence in the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the basis of agreements concluded with these entities without the consent of Georgia. While Russia and few other States recognize these entities as independent States, an overwhelming majority of States considers them as part of an internationally recognized territory of Georgia. Russia also exercises its authority over these regions by its overall control over the separatist armed groups.\n\n4. **Military Occupation of Moldova by Russia**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Russia occupies part of Moldovan territory. The Russian occupation extends over a strip of land on the east bank of Moldova\u2019s Dniester River, known as Transdniestria. Russia is the occupying power in the Moldovan territory of Transdniestria. The Operational Group of Russian Forces (OGRF) \u2013 formerly the 14th Army of the military district of Odessa of the Ministry of Defence of the USSR (14th Army) \u2013 is stationed in Transdniestria without the consent of the Republic of Moldova. The OGRF numbers between 1,500 and 2,000 Russian soldiers with significant stockpiles of weapons and ammunition. Russia also exercises overall control over the separatist armed groups of Transdniestria, i.e. the self-proclaimed \u2018Moldovan Republic of Transdniestria.\u2019 In other words, Russia is also using proxy forces.\n\n5. **Non-international armed conflicts in Syria**\n   - **Conflict Overview**: Multiple and overlapping non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) occurring in Syria. The Syrian Government and its allies are involved in NIACs against several rebel groups, including the Syrian National Army, Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamic State group, the Syrian Democratic Forces and other smaller armed groups. Furthermore, there are also parallel NIACs between those armed groups operating in the territory. Finally, multiple NIACs are taking place between foreign state forces and armed groups on Syrian territory: two parallel NIACs between the US-led coalition on the one hand, and the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda on the other hand; two NIACs between T\u00fcrkiye and respectively the Islamic State and Kurdish militia and, finally, a NIAC between Israel and Hezbollah.",
