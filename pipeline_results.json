        "Output": "Based on the research data provided, the United Kingdom is involved in the following conflicts:\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflicts in Syria\n\n**Conflict Overview:**\nMultiple and overlapping non-international armed conflicts (NIACs) are occurring in Syria. The Syrian Government and its allies are involved in NIACs against several rebel groups, including the Syrian National Army, Hay\u2019at Tahrir al-Sham, the Islamic State group, the Syrian Democratic Forces, and other smaller armed groups. Additionally, there are parallel NIACs between these armed groups operating in the territory. Furthermore, multiple NIACs are taking place between foreign state forces and armed groups on Syrian territory:\n\n- Two parallel NIACs between the US-led coalition and the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda.\n- Two NIACs between T\u00fcrkiye and the Islamic State and Kurdish militia.\n- A NIAC between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nAll parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking, and unfair trials. All parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n**State Parties:**\nUnited States of America, T\u00fcrkiye, Germany, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Syrian Arab Republic, France, Belgium, Russian Federation, Netherlands (Kingdom of the), United Arab Emirates, Australia\n\n**Non-State Parties:**\nIslamic State group, Hezbollah, Syrian Democratic Forces (including YPG), Ahrar al-Sham, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, The Syrian National Army (SNA), former Free Syrian Army (FSA)\n\n### International Armed Conflicts in Syria\n\n**Conflict Overview:**\nSyria is currently involved in multiple, parallel international armed conflicts (IACs) against the so-called \u2018Global Coalition\u2019 (led by the United States), T\u00fcrkiye, and Israel. It is worth recalling that T\u00fcrkiye is occupying parts of the northern territory of Syria, while Israel has been occupying the Golan Heights since 1967.\n\nSeveral parallel international armed conflicts are occurring in Syria, notably against the US-led coalition, T\u00fcrkiye, and Israel:\n\n- The US-led coalition was created in September 2014. It is currently formed by 83 members, including the US, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Jordan, Morocco, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, T\u00fcrkiye, the UAE, and the UK.\n- After a gradual involvement in the Syrian civil war, in 2016 T\u00fcrkiye started its direct military operations against the Islamic State and the Kurds in Syria, without the consent of the Syrian Government. Furthermore, since August 2016 T\u00fcrkiye has occupied parts of northern Syria.\n- Since 2013, Israel has targeted Iranian and Hezbollah objectives in Syria, in addition to Syrian forces and military targets; the operations have intensified in 2021.\n\nAccording to the view adopted by the RULAC project, an international armed conflict exists whenever states carry out military operations directed against non-state armed groups in the territory of another state without the latter\u2019s consent, regardless of whether or not the territorial state responds with armed force or whether there are actual clashes between the armed forces of the states involved. This position does not exclude that there may be a parallel non-international armed conflict between the intervening state and the targeted non-state armed group, provided that the criteria for a non-international armed conflict are fulfilled.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nSyria, T\u00fcrkiye, the United States, and the other members of the coalition are party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. Syria, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Jordan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom are also a party to the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to international armed conflicts. In addition, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n**State Parties:**\nNetherlands (Kingdom of the), Italy, Belgium, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Israel, Denmark, France, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Australia, T\u00fcrkiye, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syrian Arab Republic, United States of America\n\n**Non-State Parties:**\nNone listed",

The African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS), previously African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), is a peacekeeping operation supporting the Somali government.

The situation is complicated by the presence of competing governments and a multitude of armed groups that frequently switch alliances. Since 2014, there have been overlapping non-international armed conflicts involving the internationally recognized Government of Libya, the Libyan National Army (LNA), various armed groups, and intervening foreign powers.\n\n**Key Details:**\n- The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) is engaged in conflicts with the self-declared LNA and groups loyal to General Haftar, who are aligned with the House of Representatives (HoR).\n- The GNA is also fighting against groups pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, which gained control over Derna and Sirte in 2015.\n- The LNA and its affiliated groups are fighting against the Islamic State and other armed groups, including the Derna Protection Force (DPF) and the Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC).\n- Foreign interventions include the United States launching an air campaign against the Islamic State in 2016, with Turkey supporting the GNA, and France and the United Arab Emirates supporting the LNA.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\n- Libya is a party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II, which applies to non-international armed conflicts.\n- All parties are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and customary international humanitarian law.\n- International human rights law also applies during times of armed conflict, with the territorial state having an obligation to prevent and investigate alleged violations.\n\n**State Parties Involved:**\n- United States of America\n- United Arab Emirates\n- France\n- T\u00fcrkiye\n- Libya\n\n**Non-State Parties Involved:**\n- Libyan National Army\n- Derna Protection Force (DPF)\n- The Benghazi Revolutionaries Shura Council (BRSC)\n- Islamic State group",

The primary conflicts are between the Yemeni government and various armed groups, including the Houthis, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and the Southern Transitional Council. The government is supported by an international coalition led by Saudi Arabia.\n\n2. **Non-international armed conflicts in Sudan**:\n   - Within Sudan, there are several parallel non-international armed conflicts.

        "Output": "Based on the research data provided, both India and Pakistan have been involved in the following conflicts:\n\n### International Armed Conflict between India and Pakistan\n**Conflict Overview:** India and Pakistan are involved in an international armed conflict over the status of Kashmir. The disputed status of Kashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan since the first Indo-Pakistan war in 1947. In particular, since 2013, ceasefire violations and border skirmishes have increased. Therefore, the two countries continue to be involved in an international armed conflict.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:** India and Pakistan are party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. In addition, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law.\n\n**State Parties:** Pakistan, India\n\n**Conflict Classification:** International Armed Conflict (IAC)\n\n### International Armed Conflict between Afghanistan and Pakistan\n**Conflict Overview:** Since October 2021, Pakistan and Afghanistan have engaged in border clashes.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:** Both countries are parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and to the 1977 Additional Protocol I applicable to international armed conflicts. Furthermore, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict, but it is controversial whether it also applies to extra-territorial airstrikes.\n\n**State Parties:** Pakistan, Afghanistan\n\n**Conflict Classification:** International Armed Conflict (IAC)\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflicts in Pakistan\n**Conflict Overview:** There are multiple and overlapping armed conflicts in Pakistan. The conflicts have also spilled over into Afghanistan. In 2002, Pakistan began conducting military operations against foreign fighters hiding in its tribal areas. In response to these attacks, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan group (TTP) formed out of veterans of armed conflicts in neighboring countries, such as Afghanistan, and local tribal groups. In 2004, Pakistan began launching military offensives against fighters believed to be affiliated to al-Qaeda in the tribal areas near its Afghan border. The United States simultaneously began targeting suspected al-Qaeda members in the same area through drone strikes. Further offensives were launched in subsequent years. In 2014, Pakistan launched a \u2018counter-terrorism\u2019 operation, Zarb-e-Azb, against various non-state armed groups. In parallel, armed groups are fighting the government over independence of the province of Balochistan.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:** All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials. In addition, all parties are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflict. In addition to international humanitarian law, international human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict. Under human rights law, the territorial state has an obligation to prevent and to investigate alleged violations, including by non-state actors. Non-state armed groups are increasingly considered to be bound by international human rights law if they exercise de facto control over some areas.\n\n**State Parties:** Pakistan\n\n**Conflict Classification:** Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)\n\n**Non-State Parties:** The Baloch Liberation Army, Tehrik-i-Taliban (TTP), Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, IS-K, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, The Haqqani network\n\n### International Armed Conflict between India and China\n**Conflict Overview:** India and China are involved in an international armed conflict over the control of two main regions, namely Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh, and a number of smaller regions along the Sino-Indian border. India and China are involved in an international armed conflict over the control of two main regions: Arunachal Pradesh and Aksai Chin, which is considered as part of Xingjian and Tibet by China, while according to India it is part of Ladakh.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:** India and China are party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. In addition, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law. Customary international law consists of unwritten rules that come from a general practice accepted as law.\n\n**State Parties:** China, India\n\n**Conflict Classification:** International Armed Conflict (IAC)\n\n### Non-International Armed Conflict in India\n**Conflict Overview:** The Government of India is involved in a non-international armed conflict with the Communist Party of India-Maoist, a non-state armed group (this group is also frequently referred to as the Naxalites). Although various incarnations of this group have been involved in some form of insurgency since 1967; an increase in the intensity of violence in the late 2000s means that the situation currently qualifies as a non-international armed conflict. Furthermore, there is a NIAC between India and the separatist groups in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:** All parties to the conflict are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions that provides for the minimum standard to be respected and requires humane treatment without adverse distinction of all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking and unfair trials.

        "Output": "The conflict in Ukraine is classified into two distinct categories according to the data provided:\n\n1. **Military Occupation**:\n   - **Conflict Name**: Military occupation of Ukraine by Russia\n   - **Overview**: Since March 2014, Russia has occupied Crimea. Additionally, Russia has been occupying large territories in the south and east of Ukraine since February 2022. The alleged consent for Russian intervention and the Crimean referendum do not alter the status of the occupation.\n   - **Applicable IHL**: The law of military occupation applies, as set forth in Articles 42 to 56 of the 1907 Hague Regulations, the fourth 1949 Geneva Convention, and the 1977 Additional Protocol I. Both Russia and Ukraine are bound by these conventions and customary international humanitarian law. International human rights law also applies, obliging the occupying power to secure the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\n2. **International Armed Conflict (IAC)**:\n   - **Conflict Name**: International armed conflict in Ukraine\n   - **Overview**: Between February 2014 and February 2022, there was an international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, along with parallel non-international armed conflicts between Ukraine and separatist groups. In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, starting a new phase of the conflict and turning the non-international armed conflicts into international armed conflicts as Russia exercised overall control over the separatist groups.\n   - **Applicable IHL**: Both Russia and Ukraine are parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Additional Protocol I. They are also bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. International human rights law continues to apply during times of armed conflict.\n\n### State Parties Involved:\n- Ukraine\n- Russian Federation\n\n### Non-State Parties Involved:\n- Russian-backed militias\n- Ukrainian separatist groups\n\nThese classifications and the applicable international humanitarian law (IHL) frameworks are crucial for understanding the legal obligations and rights of the parties involved in the conflict.",

According to the data provided, there is currently a non-international armed conflict in T\u00fcrkiye between the Turkish armed and security forces and the PKK. This conflict, which had lasted with some interruption from the 1980s until 2013, resumed in July 2015. The conflict also spills over into Syria and Iraq, leading to parallel international armed conflicts with these countries due to the Turkish use of force on their territories without their consent.\n\n### Conflict Details:\n\n**Conflict Name:** Non-international armed conflict in T\u00fcrkiye\n\n**Conflict Overview:**\nThe conflict involves the Turkish armed and security forces and the PKK. It has been ongoing with interruptions since the 1980s and resumed in July 2015. The conflict spills over into Syria and Iraq, intertwining with the ongoing non-international armed conflicts in those countries. The Turkish use of force on Iraqi and Syrian territory without the consent of the territorial states has led to parallel international armed conflicts with Iraq and Syria.\n\n**Applicable International Humanitarian Law:**\nT\u00fcrkiye is a state party to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions but did not ratify the 1977 Additional Protocol applicable to non-international armed conflicts. Both T\u00fcrkiye and the PKK are bound by Article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which provides for the minimum standard of humane treatment without adverse distinction for all persons not or no longer taking active parts in hostilities. It prohibits murder, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, hostage taking, and unfair trials. Additionally, they are bound by customary international humanitarian law applicable to non-international armed conflicts. T\u00fcrkiye is also a state party to the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Convention, which prohibits the use of anti-personnel mines and requires the destruction of all such mines in mined areas under their jurisdiction.\n\n**State Parties:** T\u00fcrkiye\n\n**Non-State Parties:** Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)\n\n**Conflict Classification:** Non-International Armed Conflict (NIAC)",
