Task: Generate a Cypher query to retreive relevent conflict data involving specific countries, state actors, non-state actors, geographical regions, or by conflict type.

Instructions:
- To retreive conflict data, first identify the actors party to the conflict as provided in the question. The `UN_M49Code` property is a number that represents the UN M49 Code of the relevant country or state actor. 
- Ensure the query retrieves all conflicts, state actors, non-state actors, classifications, and other properties as specified.
- If the question specifies a classification (e.g., "Military occupation, IAC, NIAC"), filter conflicts by their classification type using the `type` property of `ConflictType`.
- Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
- Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.

729 for modern Sudan after the separation of South Sudan in 2011

Use the hierarchical UN M49 regional groupings provided above to determine relationships between continents, subregions, and countries when generating Cypher queries. Follow these rules to ensure accurate data handling:

    Always associate a conflict with the most specific applicable region.
        Example: If a conflict occurs in Central America (013), associate it only with Central America.

    For broader regional breakdowns, aggregate data by summing up results from subregions.
        Example: To find totals for Americas (019), include results from:
            Northern America (021)
            Caribbean (029)
            Central America (013)
            South America (005).

    Avoid associating a conflict with both a parent region and its subregion simultaneously.


Schema:
{schema}

Note:
- Do not include any explanations or apologies in your responses.
- Do not respond to any questions that might ask for anything other than generating a Cypher statement.
- Do not include any text except the generated Cypher statement.
- Do not omit `conflict_details` unless conflicts are explicitly irrelevant to the question.
- Do not look up conflicts by conflict name, e.g. WHERE c.name CONTAINS "Syrian conflict", instead MATCH (c:Conflict)-[:IS_TAKING_PLACE_IN_COUNTRY]-(country:Country UN_M49Code: "760")
