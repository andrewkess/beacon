PROMPT = """### About Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts (RULAC)  

The Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts (RULAC) project, managed by the Geneva Academy of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, is a unique online portal that systematically classifies situations of armed conflict worldwide. It provides information on the parties involved and the applicable international legal frameworks. The goal is to offer independent and impartial classifications of armed conflicts based on open-source information, making it accessible to both legal experts and non-specialists in international humanitarian law (IHL).

RULAC serves as a legal reference tool for professionals, including government officials, international organizations, NGOs, journalists, and academics, working on humanitarian and security issues.

#### Objectives of RULAC

The RULAC project provides legal insights into:
- Definitions and categories of armed conflicts under international humanitarian law.
- The legal framework governing armed conflicts.
- Criteria for armed conflict classification under IHL.
- Parties involved in these conflicts.

Conflict classification is a complex task. Governments may mischaracterize conflicts for political reasons—either denying the existence of a conflict or wrongly applying IHL to situations not legally classified as armed conflicts. Additionally, modern conflicts often involve multiple state and non-state actors, making classification even more challenging.

RULAC focuses on legal principles to assess and illustrate the classification of conflicts and their parties. By making this information available through accessible formats, including visual tools, RULAC helps enhance public understanding of armed conflict classifications and their consequences.

Under international humanitarian law, a situation qualifies as an armed conflict only if it meets specific legal thresholds. Below this threshold, international human rights law (which imposes stricter limits on the use of force and detention) applies. The distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts is also crucial, affecting combatant status, legal obligations, and enforcement mechanisms.

By providing an independent and well-researched classification, RULAC aims to foster better implementation of international legal frameworks, ensuring accountability and victim protection.

#### RULAC Methodology

RULAC applies international humanitarian law to classify situations of armed violence and identify conflict parties. IHL recognizes two main conflict categories:
- International Armed Conflicts (IACs) – involving at least two states, including military occupations.
- Non-International Armed Conflicts (NIACs) – between government forces and organized non-state armed groups or between such groups.

These categories encompass various conflict scenarios, from asymmetric warfare (e.g., drone strikes) to complex civil wars involving multiple non-state actors. However, internal disturbances or riots do not qualify as armed conflicts under IHL.

The classification process relies on open-source intelligence, including NGO reports, international organization assessments, media sources, and legal texts. 

#### Scope of RULAC

RULAC strictly focuses on situations classified as armed conflicts under international humanitarian law. Other forms of violence—such as political conflicts or localized violence that do not meet IHL thresholds—are not covered. However, this exclusion does not downplay their humanitarian significance.

#### Updates & Monitoring

RULAC constantly monitors over 110 armed conflicts involving at least 55 states and more than 70 non-state actors. Updates are based on desk research and secondary sources, ensuring accuracy despite rapidly changing conflict landscapes. In cases where new developments may affect conflict classification, additional fact-checking measures are undertaken.

Besides listed conflicts, RULAC monitors other situations that may qualify as armed conflicts under IHL but have not yet been classified."""
