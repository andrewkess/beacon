**Article 3: Trump ‘angry’ with Putin and threatens tariffs on Russian oil over Ukraine**

Publication Date: 2025-03-30

Summary: US President Donald Trump has said he is "p***** off" at Russian President Vladimir Putin and has threatened to impose secondary tariffs on Russian oil if Moscow does not agree to a ceasefire to end its war in Ukraine. Trump's comments came after Putin questioned the legitimacy of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and suggested that a temporary administration be established in Ukraine under the supervision of the United Nations.

**Article 4: Why is Trump ‘very angry’ with Putin and who will secondary tariffs hurt?**

Publication Date: 2025-03-31

Summary: Trump's threat of secondary tariffs on Russian oil is aimed at countries that buy Russian oil, including India and China, which are the two biggest buyers of inexpensive Russian crude. The tariffs could hurt these countries, particularly India, which has long been accused of buying subsidised Russian oil and refining it for sale to the West. The US has already imposed 20 percent tariffs on all imports from China, and Trump has threatened reciprocal, tit-for-tat tariffs from April 2 against all US trading partners.

**Analysis**

The current situation in Ukraine is complex and volatile, with both Russia and Ukraine trading accusations that the other is seeking to derail a ceasefire. The US and Ukraine have agreed to a 30-day ceasefire, but its implementation remains unclear, and Russia has not signed the proposal, citing reservations about Ukraine's intentions.

Putin's conditions for a ceasefire, outlined in Article 1, are a key factor in the current stalemate. Russia's concerns about Ukraine's intentions and the potential for Ukraine to mobilize new forces and receive new weapons during the ceasefire are likely to be major obstacles to a peaceful resolution.

Trump's threat of secondary tariffs on Russian oil, as outlined in Article 3 and Article 4, is a new development in the conflict. While the tariffs could potentially hurt countries that buy Russian oil, including India and China, it is unclear whether this threat will be effective in pressuring Russia to agree to a ceasefire.

Overall, the situation in Ukraine remains precarious, with both sides dug in and unwilling to compromise. The international community, including the US, the EU, and other key players, will need to continue to exert pressure on both sides to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
